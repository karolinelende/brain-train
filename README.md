# BrainTrain

BrainTrain is a (work in progress) cognitive games platform built in LiveView.

Games currently built:

- SpeedSort (a 1-player game requiring you to sort numbers)
- TicTacToe (a 2-player game based on the classic three-in-a-row)

## How to run

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
